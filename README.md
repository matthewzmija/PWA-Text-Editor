# PWA-Text-Editor

## Description

The task at hand was to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app is also designed to be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The app is also built to function offline.

## Usage

Upon your initial page load, you will be greeted with a welcome message and you will have the ability to enter text into the text editor. When entering text into the editor, your document will be automatically saved and can be reloaded the next time the page is launched, provided that you click away from it. Offline use is achieved by the employment of service workers and workbox.
